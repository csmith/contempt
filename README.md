# Contempt - CONtainer file TEMPlaTing

Contempt is a tool to generate Dockerfiles (or Containerfiles) from templates.

It comes with support for various useful functions for getting the latest versions
of software, expanding out the dependency trees of package managers, and so on.

TODO: Flesh out instructions a bit more when it actually works...
